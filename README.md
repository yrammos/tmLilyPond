tmLilyPond
==========

Enhanced LilyPond syntax highlighter for the [TextMate](http://macromates.com) editor.

**NOTE:** tmLilyPond is a TextMate port of my [SubLilyPond](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond) highlighter for Sublime Text. For screenshots, release history, and other pertinent information, please follow the link above.

### Motivation

TextMate currently ships with Jacob Rus's `LilyPond.tmbundle`, which provides a rather basic LilyPond grammar definition for syntax highlighting. `tmLilyPond` is intended as an upgrade for the standard LilyPond syntax in TextMate. To prevent conflicts between the two highlighters, it is suggested that you disable the standard one as shown in the screenshot below. All other features in Rus's original LilyPond bundle (commands, snippets, etc.) will continue to work normally.
